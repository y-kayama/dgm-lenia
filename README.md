# DGM Lenia: Metamorphic Transitions in Artificial Life

## Overview

Welcome to the official website for **DGM Lenia** research! This study delves into the fascinating world of **Lenia**, a continuous cellular automaton framework that enables the emergence of **complex, autonomous lifeforms** [1,2,3,4]. Building upon Lenia's capacity for self-organization, resilience, and adaptive behaviors, our research introduces **Dynamic Growth Mechanisms (DGM)** to explore the emergence and particularly **metamorphosis-like transitions** of artificial lifeforms from simple initial configurations [5].

DGM represents a novel approach consisting of **three interconnected extensions** [5]:

1.  **Dual-phase Growth**: This mechanism combines the growth rules of Original Lenia [1,2] and Asymptotic Lenia [6,7]. Inspired by biological evolution and development, it promotes the **co-occurrence of lifeforms** derived from both Original Lenia and those from Asymptotic Lenia with Kernel Translation, all within the same model.
2.  **Kernel Scaling**: Here, the kernel is treated as an evolving cell attribute. This provides a crucial foundation for introducing locality and **symmetry breaking** in the system.
3.  **Kernel Translation**: This extension deliberately breaks rotational symmetry by applying an **offset vector (δ)** to the kernel. This symmetry breaking is vital for fostering **biodiversity** and promoting the organization of complex lifeforms.

Through comprehensive simulations of Dual-phase Lenia and DGM Lenia, we have successfully generated a **diverse array of lifeforms** and observed their **dynamic transitions**. A **key finding** is that the **offset vector (δ) in Kernel Translation plays a critical role** in shaping the parameter space for the emergence of organisms and their transitions. Specifically, appropriate δ values establish a distinct region that significantly **enhances the emergence of diverse lifeforms**, particularly those classified as **Optium/Dioptium-class organisms**. This mechanism induces **non-linear fusion** and complex morphologies, contributing new insights into evolutionary pathways in artificial life systems.

Our observations include intriguing behaviors such as **Optium pair production and fusion into Dioptium**, as well as complex transformations like the **transition from Dioptium to two Optium**, **Dioptigon to Dioptium**, and **Dioptigon to Dioptijetgon**. These dynamic behaviors and lifeform transitions are vividly illustrated in this **supplementary online video gallery**.

Explore our research to understand how these Dynamic Growth Mechanisms offer new avenues for modeling and understanding complex natural phenomena, contributing to the study of artificial life, cellular automata, and the principles of self-organization.
